# Multimedia Asset Tracker (WebApp)
This is a repurposed build of a web-application that was used internally at REPLI LLC. The production build contained sensitive content to specific apartment community management teams. This refactored version uses publically sourced data to protect the confidentiality of previous clients. All data is being housed on a FaunaDB cloud cluster and the front-end is being rendered with Next.js. Refer to build specifics below: 

## Builds
